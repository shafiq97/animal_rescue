  <h1>Safe Paws Terms & Conditions</h1>
  <p>In order to provide a harmonious and effective environment for our community, please carefully adhere to the following Terms & Conditions when participating at Safe Paws. You must agree to the following rules if you wish to participate at Safe Paws.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Pets Listings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>For Adoption:</strong> Only pets that are genuinely for adoption may be listed here. Pets for sale cannot be listed under this status. Adopters may not adopt a pet with the intention of reselling it.</li>
        <li><strong>For Sale:</strong> All pets for sale must contain photo, price and contact number. You may not list items/products for sale here.</li>
        <li><strong>Lost:</strong> This section is for listing pets that are Lost. If you have recovered your pet subsequently, please change the status to Owner's Pet accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Found:</strong> This section is for listing pets that are Found, where the rightful owner is being sought after. If you managed to find its actual owner thereafter, you can either change its status to Owner's Pet or just deactivate it.</li>
        <li>You may not intentionally refresh your pet profile for the sole purpose of updating it to the front of the pet listings. This is considered an abuse of the system and profiles in violation will be removed.</li>
        <li>Safe Paws reserves the right to remove any listings deemed inaccurate or in violation of terms without prior notice, and the violating account may be blacklisted.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <p>You may submit comments, feedback or enquiries at the Pet and Member Comment sections of each profile. You may not abuse this facility by hijacking the discussion with irrelevant information, repeated spam, abusive language or false accusations. You may not contact other members for any promotions, sales or solicitations, which are considered as spamming and would result in the blacklisting of your account.</p>

    <li>
      <h3>Avoid Flammable Topics - Religion, Politics & Racial Issues</h3>
